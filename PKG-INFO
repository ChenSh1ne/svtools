        Tools for processing and analyzing structural variants.
        
        Typical usage often looks like this::
        
        		usage:    svtools <subcommand> [options]
        
        The svtools sub-commands include:
        
        [ general utilities ]
        
          vcftobedpe      converts vcf file into bedpe\.
        
          bedpetovcf      convets bedpe file to vcf\.
        
          vcfsort            sorts a vcf file\.
        
          bedpesort            sorts a bedpe file\.
        
        [ callset generation ]
        
          prune           cluster a BEDPE file by position based on allele frequency\.
        
          varlookup       look for variants common between two bedpes\.
        
          afreq           add allele frequency information to a VCF file.
        
          lsort           sorts a vcf file by type.
        
          lsort           merges multiple sorted vcf files.
        
          genotype        return a vcf file with genotype information added by svtyper.
        
          copynumber      add cn information using cnvnator.
        
          lpaste          combine multiple vcf files produced by genotype command.
        
          svscore         annotate vcf with cadd scores
        
          vcfanno         annotate vcf by features
