# Support Guidelines

Please ensure you've read the existing [README.md](README.md) and
[Tutorial.md](Tutorial.md).

When submitting a possible bug report, the following information is extremely
helpful:
* The version of svtools you're using.  The precise command line you used when
* you encountered the issue.  Any error output from the svtools.

If you are able to provide a small file that reproduces the error, then you are
much more likely to get a quick fix as this gives the developers an easy way to
reproduce the error.
